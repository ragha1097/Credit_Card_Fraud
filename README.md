# Credit_Card_Fraud
The objective is to develop a logistic regression model to classify and distinguish normal and fraudulent transactions.The dataset is obtained from kaggle and due to confidentiality issues the original features were not provided.Features V1 to V28 were obtained after PCA.Only the features time and amount were not transformed.Time represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first one and the feature 'Amount' is the transaction amount.

#Under Sampling
The data set is highly imbalanced with only 0.17% being fraudulent transaction.The technique of undersampling was used to balance uneven dataset

#Logistic Regression
A logistic regression model was developed and an accuracy score of 94% was achieved
